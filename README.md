# HalalYouCanEat

## Product Summary

Halal is a dietary restriction for Muslims (like the Muslim equivalent of Kosher).
Not all restaurants have all halal/zabiha options. However, there are many restaurants that may have part
of their menu be halal (their chicken is halal but not their beef), but as a result, not be considered halal
when searched on Google. Sometimes restaurants themselves arenâ€™t aware that they are sourcing from a
halal/zabiha supplier. The app would help people find halal restaurants based on their location. However,
this app would also allow users to add restaurants that they have found to use halal/zabiha in part or all
their menu.
