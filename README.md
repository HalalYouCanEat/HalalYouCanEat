# HalalYouCanEat

## Product Summary

Halal is a dietary restriction for Muslims (like the Muslim equivalent of Kosher).
Not all restaurants have all halal/zabiha options. However, there are many restaurants that may have part
of their menu be halal (their chicken is halal but not their beef), but as a result, not be considered halal
when searched on Google. Sometimes restaurants themselves arenâ€™t aware that they are sourcing from a
halal/zabiha supplier. The app would help people find halal restaurants based on their location. However,
this app would also allow users to add restaurants that they have found to use halal/zabiha in part or all
their menu.

## Functionality Summary
We have functionality for the map and list views to find restaurants and view information about the restaurant such as rating, location, reviews, etc. User can also search for a restaurant and filter based on desired cuisine and city. Some key features of our app are the map, the list view of the restaurants, the ability to add a restaurant to favorites, and the ability to suggest a new restaurant not already listed in our database.

## URL Pattern Plans

### About URLs

/about/app<br>
/about/devs<br>
/about/halal<br>
/about/assets

### Filter/Search URLs

/restaurants/search?name=&cuisine%5B%5D=Afghan&commit=Filter (searches for restaurants that has Afghan cuisine)<br>
/restaurants/search?name=&city%5B%5D=+Brooklyn&commit=Filter (searches for restaurants that are in Brooklyn)<br>
/restaurants/search?name=Ayat&commit=Filter (searches for restaurants that contains "Ayat" in it)<br>

The user has the ability to choose between different types of filters (cuisines, cities, etc.)


### Viewing Restaurants

/restaurant/1 (view one restaurant)<br>
/restaurants (view all restaurants in table view)<br>

### User URLs
/users/1 (user profile)<br>

## Views

Most of the our views are enumerated and shown in our figma: https://www.figma.com/file/1PQprB5wV0z4tIlz2E8XJO/Halal-You-Can-Eat-Wireframe?node-id=0%3A1

We have a home page which displays an active map pin pointing all of the restaurants present in our database.

We also have the following "About" pages:
1. "About the App" - Provides an overview of what the purpose of this app is.
2. "About the Devs" - Provides an introduction to the developers of this app.
3. "About Halal" - Provides a brief overview of what halal means.

We have a list view of all the restaurants present in our database, along with a filter siderbar that allows users to filter based on desired cuisine(s) and city/cities. 

For each restaurant, we have a page that provides detailed information about the restaurant such as location, cuisine, rating, reviews, etc.

We also have the user profile view where user can view their favorited restaurants, reviews, and navigate to different parts of the app.
